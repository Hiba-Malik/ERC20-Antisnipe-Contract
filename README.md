This an ERC20 sample contract. When adding a pool of liquidity, in the first second the dividend is 
bought up by the bot and users buy already at an inflated price. There are ways to counter these bots. 
This contract ensures that 5 blocks have been mined before another call to the contract is made. 
If not that user gets blacklisted.
